Vigenere Cipher Commentary: Thu Nguyen and Elizabeth Zak
1. What does this component do in a single sentence?

VigenereCipher encodes or decodes a statement based on the options chosen.
Decode takes two strings: one statement and one key and promptly shifts back
each of the letters in the statement over from the numeric value of the
key's letters.  


2. What is the interface to this component? What are its inputs and
outputs?

The interface is a public static void operation that prints as it
progresses. It takes a string and a key as an argument. Its inputs are
strings. It has no outputs.
public static void Decode (String s, String key){
